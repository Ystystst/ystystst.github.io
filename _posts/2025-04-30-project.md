Walk around San Francisco long enough, and you’ll notice something: businesses come and go. Maybe one year it’s a new café on the corner, the next year it’s a “For Lease” sign in the window. I wanted to understand this better. So I pulled data from over 20 years (2003 - 2005) of business registrations and closures—thousands of stories. As I started looking closer, I found that it's not all random. There are a few things that seem to matter more than others—when a business starts, where it starts, and what kind of business it is.

As shown in the chart, San Francisco’s business environment remained quite robust before 2021. Each year brought an increasing number of new business registrations, while closures were almost negligible. This suggests that most newly registered businesses during this period can stay afloat — a sign of economic optimism and growth. However, starting around 2011, a shift becomes visible. We can see a gradual rise in business closures, and by 2018, the trend escalates sharply — almost like a cliff. One possible explanation could be the devastating California wildfires that year, which severely disrupted communities and local economies [[1](#ref1)].

Although closure numbers declined slightly after 2018, the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic introduced new challenges. As shown in the chart, from 2018 to 2022, the number of closures consistently exceeded new registrations. This likely reflects the economic uncertainty and reduced consumer activity during the pandemic, making it harder for new businesses to survive [[2](#ref2)].

So yes — when a business starts clearly matters. The data shows how broader events can shape its chances of survival, even if the idea itself never changes. But timing isn’t everything. Where a business sets up shop also plays a role. Some parts of the city seem to offer more fertile ground than others as next map shown.

As shown in the map, business registrations in San Francisco are not evenly distributed across neighborhoods. You can hover over each area to view the neighborhood name and the total number of registered businesses. Darker shades indicate higher concentrations of businesses, making it easy to spot the city’s economic hotspots.

Places like the Financial District, South of Market, and Mission have attracted tens of thousands of businesses, while quieter corners like SeaCliff or Twin Peaks saw only a few hundred. This variation isn’t random—it reflects differences in economic activity, accessibility, population density, and infrastructure. These factors tend to correlate positively with the number of businesses in a given area.

But a high density of businesses doesn’t necessarily mean a longer lifespan. Are businesses in these popular neighborhoods actually surviving longer? Or are they simply replaced more quickly when others fail? Let’s turn to the next map — one that shifts the focus from how many businesses there are to how long they last.

This map visualizes the average lifespan of businesses across San Francisco neighborhoods. Again, you can hover over each region to see its name and the average number of years businesses have survived there. The darker the shade, the longer the average business lifespan.

At a glance, we can see that high-density areas like South of Market or the Mission don’t always correspond with longer survival times. In fact, some less crowded neighborhoods — such as parts of the Golden Gate Park or Presidio Heights — show surprisingly high average lifespans.

This contrast suggests that business survival isn’t just about being in the busiest part of the city. While high-traffic areas may attract more businesses, they may also come with higher rent, stiffer competition, and a faster turnover rate. For example, nearly half of all retailers in San Francisco’s Union Square have shut down since 2019 [[3](#ref3)]. On the other hand, quieter neighborhoods might offer more stability, lower overhead, and longer-lasting customer bases. So just like timing, location matters — but not always in the way we expect.
