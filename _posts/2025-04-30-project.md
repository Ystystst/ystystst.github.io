Walk around San Francisco long enough, and you’ll notice something: businesses come and go. Maybe one year it’s a new café on the corner, the next year it’s a “For Lease” sign in the window. I wanted to understand this better. So I pulled data from over 20 years (2003 - 2005) of business registrations and closures—thousands of stories. As I started looking closer, I found that it's not all random. There are a few things that seem to matter more than others—when a business starts, where it starts, and what kind of business it is.
As shown in the chart, San Francisco’s business environment remained quite robust before 2021. Each year brought an increasing number of new business registrations, while closures were almost negligible. This suggests that most newly registered businesses during this period can stay afloat — a sign of economic optimism and growth. However, starting around 2011, a shift becomes visible. We can see a gradual rise in business closures, and by 2018, the trend escalates sharply — almost like a cliff. One possible explanation could be the devastating California wildfires that year, which severely disrupted communities and local economies [[1](#ref1)].
Although closure numbers declined slightly after 2018, the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic introduced new challenges. As shown in the chart, from 2018 to 2022, the number of closures consistently exceeded new registrations. This likely reflects the economic uncertainty and reduced consumer activity during the pandemic, making it harder for new businesses to survive [[2](#ref2)].
So yes — when a business starts clearly matters. The data shows how broader events can shape its chances of survival, even if the idea itself never changes. But timing isn’t everything. Where a business sets up shop also plays a role. Some parts of the city seem to offer more fertile ground than others as next map shown.
