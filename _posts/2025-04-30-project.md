Walk around San Francisco long enough, and you’ll notice something: businesses come and go. Maybe one year it’s a new café on the corner, the next year it’s a “For Lease” sign in the window. I wanted to understand this better. So I pulled data from over 20 years (2003 - 2005) of business registrations and closures—thousands of stories. As I started looking closer, I found that it's not all random. There are a few things that seem to matter more than others—when a business starts, where it starts, and what kind of business it is.

As shown in the chart, San Francisco’s business environment was quite robust before 2021. Each year brought an increasing number of new business registrations, while closures were almost negligible. This suggests that most newly registered businesses during this period can stay afloat — a sign of economic optimism and growth. However, starting around 2011, a shift becomes visible. We can see a gradual rise in business closures, and by 2018, the trend escalates sharply — almost like a cliff. One possible explanation could be the devastating California wildfires that year, which severely disrupted communities and local economies [[1](#ref1)].

Although closure numbers declined slightly after 2018, the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic introduced new challenges. As shown in the chart, from 2018 to 2022, the number of closures consistently exceeded new registrations. This likely reflects the economic uncertainty and reduced consumer activity during the pandemic, making it harder for new businesses to survive [[2](#ref2)].

So yes — when a business starts clearly matters. The data shows how broader events can shape its chances of survival, even if the idea itself never changes. But timing isn’t everything. Where a business sets up shop also plays a role. Some parts of the city seem to offer more fertile ground than others as next map shown.

As shown in the map, business registrations in San Francisco are not evenly distributed across neighborhoods. You can hover over each area to view the neighborhood name and the total number of registered businesses. Darker shades indicate higher concentrations of businesses, making it easy to spot the city’s economic hotspots.

Places like the Financial District, South of Market, and Mission have attracted tens of thousands of businesses, while quieter corners like SeaCliff or Twin Peaks saw only a few hundred. This variation isn’t random—it reflects differences in economic activity, accessibility, population density, and infrastructure. These factors tend to correlate positively with the number of businesses in a given area.

<iframe src="/assets/neighborhood_density.html" width="800" height="600" style="max-width:100%; display:block; margin:auto;"></iframe>

But a high density of businesses doesn’t necessarily mean a longer lifespan. Are businesses in these popular neighborhoods actually surviving longer? Or are they simply replaced more quickly when others fail? Let’s turn to the next map — one that shifts the focus from how many businesses there are to how long they last.

This map visualizes the average lifespan of businesses across San Francisco neighborhoods. Again, you can hover over each region to see its name and the average number of years businesses have survived there. The darker the shade, the longer the average business lifespan.

At a glance, we can see that high-density areas like South of Market or the Mission don’t always correspond with longer survival times. In fact, some less crowded neighborhoods — such as parts of the Golden Gate Park or Presidio Heights — show surprisingly high average lifespans.

This contrast suggests that business survival isn’t just about being in the busiest part of the city. While high-traffic areas may attract more businesses, they may also come with higher rent, stiffer competition, and a faster turnover rate. For example, nearly half of all retailers in San Francisco’s Union Square have shut down since 2019 [[3](#ref3)]. On the other hand, quieter neighborhoods might offer more stability, lower overhead, and longer-lasting customer bases. So just like timing, location matters — but not always in the way we expect.

<iframe src="/assets/business_lifespan_by_neighborhood.html" width="800" height="600" style="max-width:100%; display:block;margin:auto;"></iframe>

Let’s shift focus from where businesses are located to what kind of businesses they are. Not all industries offer the same odds of survival — and the next chart makes that pretty clear.

This interactive plot shows how long businesses in different industries tend to last. The denser the dots are near the top, the longer the average lifespan; the more crowded near the bottom, the shorter it is.

The Information industry tells a clear story (you can click the Information industry to see): most businesses cluster below the 10-year mark, and there are relatively few long-lived outliers. It’s a field known for rapid innovation and disruption, which might explain the shorter average lifespan. If you then switch to the Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services industry, the picture looks more promising — a noticeable number of businesses appear to have lasted 10, even 20 years. But seeing more long-lived businesses doesn’t necessarily mean this industry is “safe.” The bottom of the chart still shows a dense layer of short-lived ventures, suggesting that while the rewards might be high, the risks remain just as real. So if you dive into this field blindly, there’s still a good chance you’ll end up as one of the many dots clustered at the bottom. To get a clearer comparison across industries, I created a bar chart that shows the proportion of businesses in each sector that survived more than ten years.

<iframe src="/assets/industry_lifespan.html" width="100%" height="480" style="max-width: 800px; margin: auto; display: block;" ></iframe>

This bar chart provides a helpful summary of what we can explored visually in the scatter plots. It makes it easier to compare industries head-to-head, and it further emphasizes how much your business’s longevity depends on the field you choose. Industries like Real Estate and Financial Services sit at the top, with over 40% of their businesses surviving more than ten years. This longevity appears to attract more individuals to these sectors. For instance, the real estate sector in San Francisco has recently seen a resurgence of interest. Amid what local media call the city’s “reset,” more business owners are entering the market not just as tenants, but as owner-users — buying properties to house their own operations [[4](#ref4)]. Similarly, the financial services sector is experiencing substantial growth. For instance, two-thirds of mid-sized financial services companies reported expanding employment in 2024, with the same proportion expecting to grow their staffs in 2025 [[5](#ref5)]. Meanwhile, Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services — the industry we previously mentioned — falls somewhere in the middle. It turns out the field isn’t quite as “long-lived” as the scatter plot might have suggested at first glance. While some businesses do endure, many others may struggle to stay afloat. Finally, industries like Transportation and Accommodations sit at the bottom of the chart, with the lowest proportions of businesses surviving more than a decade. These sectors are often characterized by high operating costs, tight regulations, and economic sensitivity — factors that can make long-term survival particularly difficult. The data underscores the volatility of these industries, where many ventures struggle to stay afloat for more than a few years.

So what makes a business endure? As this data story shows, it’s rarely just luck. When and where a business starts—and what industry it enters—can all shape its odds of survival. Some fields offer stability, some neighborhoods offer longevity, and some time periods offer better chances than others. There’s no perfect formula, but one thing is clear: paying attention to the bigger picture can make all the difference when it comes to building something that lasts.
