Walk around San Francisco long enough, and you’ll notice something: businesses come and go. Maybe one year it’s a new café on the corner, the next year it’s a “For Lease” sign in the window. I wanted to understand this better. So I pulled data from over 20 years (2003 - 2005) of business registrations and closures—thousands of stories. As I started looking closer, I found that it's not all random. There are a few things that seem to matter more than others—when a business starts, where it starts, and what kind of business it is.
